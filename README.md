## Arduino

This class uses a library published through the Arduino IDE to hold the starter code for each lab. View the library reference for ENGR100-950 [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/engr100-950/).

View the library status from Arduino [here](https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/logs/github.com/engin100/950/). This is useful for monitoring builds and deployments of new versions.

## Power Boards

The KiCAD files for the power management PCBs we print and launch on high altitude weather balloons are located [here](https://github.com/engin100/power-boards).
