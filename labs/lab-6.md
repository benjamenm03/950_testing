## Materials

- [ ] 3 different types of insulation
- [ ] Finished Breadboard
- [ ] Battery Pack
- [ ] 1 Box

## Temperature

For the temperature trials, we will use the cold chamber to simulate the cold that your PCB will have to endure in the atmosphere. You will use three different materials as insulation for your preliminary structures When you have sufficiently insulated your breadboard you will attach your batteries, and place it into the cold chamber. Make sure that you are writing data to the SD as fast as possible, and you will take data for about 4 minutes and plot each trial on the same graph. 

Use 3 different insulations at your disposal. (possibilities include, hard foam, cotton balls, fluff, etc...)

- For trial 1 you will insulate your box make sure you have insulation on all sides of the breadboard. You will attach your batteries to your breadboard, and using the programs you have already written you will record TMP36 data on your SD for 4 minutes. Plot the data and make sure the TMP36 reaches a constant temperature if it doesn’t try again for a longer period of time.

- For trial 2 you will insulate your box, make sure you have insulation on all sides of the breadboard. You will attach your batteries to your breadboard, and using the programs you have already written you will record TMP36 data on your SD for 4 minutes. Plot the data and make sure the TMP36 reaches a constant temperature if it doesn’t try again for a longer period of time.

- For trial 3 you will insulate your box, make sure you have insulation on all sides of the breadboard. You will attach your batteries to your breadboard, and using the programs you have already written you will record TMP36 data on your SD for 4 minutes. Plot the data and make sure the TMP36 reaches a constant temperature if it doesn’t try again for a longer period of time. After you have completed your 3 trials you will plot all three data sets on the same graph, making sure to label each line appropriately. Add the plot into your post-lab questions doc at the end.

## Accelerometer

For the Accelerometer trials, you will be dropping your payload very carefully from chest height. This will simulate a bit of the turbulence that your PCB will face. You will do 3 trials, each with different materials for padding. Make sure that your breadboard has sufficient padding on all sides and that you are dropping it in a way that the wires are still facing up when it hits the ground. Make sure you are writing data to the SD as fast as possible, and you will be recording data for the duration of the drop.

- For trial 1 you will insulate your box, make sure you have insulation on all sides of the breadboard. You will attach your batteries to your breadboard, and using the programs you have already written you will record Accelerometer data on your SD for the duration of the drop.

- For trial 2 you will insulate your box, make sure you have insulation on all sides of the breadboard. You will attach your batteries to your breadboard, and using the programs you have already written you will record Accelerometer data on your SD for the duration of the drop.

- For trial 3 you will insulate your box, make sure you have insulation on all sides of the breadboard. You will attach your batteries to your breadboard, and using the programs you have already written you will record Accelerometer data on your SD for the duration of the drop.

## Submission

On Canvas, you will submit ***ONE PDF*** that will include all of the following:

- [ ] Using your gathered data, what would you use to insulate/protect your payload? Explain why!
- [ ] All three TMP36 trials for the three insulations plotted on 1 plot. Include labels for each axis, and label the 3 lines as each trial respectively. Make sure to include which trial is for which insulation in the caption or legend.
- [ ] 3 accelerometer plots, one for each trial. Make sure to include appropriate labels for each plot.

To put said content into a PDF, it is suggested you create a new Google Doc ([docs.new](https://docs.new)) and paste your images and write any text in the document. Export/Download this document as a PDF and upload it. **DO NOT SUBMIT A GOOGLE DOC FILE OR SPREADSHEET FILES.**

Submitting anything other than a single PDF may result in your work not being graded or your scores being heavily delayed.
